TopUSGoalScorers
=================
This visualization was built by [GraphAlchemist](http://graphalchemist.com/) inspired by the [Jezebel article](http://jezebel.com/world-cup-soccer-stats-erase-the-sports-most-dominant-p-1601275793) written by Valeria Alexander. Each bar represents the total number of goals scored by a player, and each dot represents an individual goal scored.

GraphAlchemist is a Portland, OR based company focused on telling stories with data. We think that data is a powerful tool in conveying just about any type of information.

It is deployed on [gh-pages](http://graphalchemist.github.io/TopUSGoalScorers).
